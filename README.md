## Overview

Coral is the **Application Intelligence Mesh**. It brings the "observe
everything" philosophy of DTrace to distributed systems, replacing esoteric
scripts with natural language and sandboxed TypeScript. It unites the deep,
kernel-level visibility of eBPF with the reasoning power of Large Language
Models.

Unlike traditional tools that just show you dashboards, Coral is
building a Programmable Observability Engine capable of writing and deploying
its own safe, ephemeral diagnostics to solve problems faster than any human can
type.

## The Problem: Observability is Fragmented and Passive

Modern distributed applications run across a "chaos of environments" — laptops,
Kubernetes clusters, edge nodes, and multiple clouds. Current tools fail this
reality in three ways:

1. **The Context Gap**: Metrics tell you _that_ something is wrong, but not
   _where_ in the code. You’re forced to jump between dashboards, traces, and
   source code, manually trying to correlate timestamps.
2. **The "Observer Effect"**: To get deeper data, you often have to add logging,
   redeploy, and pray the issue happens again. This is slow, risky, and often
   changes the very behavior you’re trying to debug.
3. **Passive Data, Active Toil**: Traditional tools are passive collectors. They
   wait for you to ask the right question. In a distributed mesh, finding the "
   right question" is 90% of the work.

**Coral turns this upside down.** We provide the **depth of a kernel debugger**
with the **reasoning of an AI**, unified into a single intelligence mesh.

## One Interface for Everything

Coral integrates four layers of data collection to provide complete visibility:

| Level | Feature                 | Description                                                                     |
| ----- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0** | **Passive RED Metrics** | Zero-config service metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration) via eBPF. No code changes. |
| **1** | **External Telemetry**  | Ingests traces/metrics from apps already using OpenTelemetry/OTLP.              |
| **2** | **Continuous Intel**    | Always-on host metrics (CPU/Mem/Disk) and low-overhead continuous profiling.    |
| **3** | **Deep Introspection**  | On-demand profiling, function-level tracing, and active investigation.          |

### 👁️ Observe

**Passive, always-on data collection.**

Coral automatically gathers telemetry from your applications and infrastructure
without any configuration.

- **Zero-config eBPF**: Metrics for every service, instantly.
- **Host Health**: Continuous monitoring of CPU, memory, disk, and network.
- **Continuous Profiling**: Low-overhead background CPU profiling to identify
  hot paths over time.
- **Dependency Mapping**: Automatically discovers how services connect.

### 🔍 Explore

**Deep introspection and investigation tools.**

When you need to dig deeper, Coral gives you the tools to investigate actively
or automate the discovery of hotspots.

- **Remote Execution**: Run standard tools like `netstat`, `curl`, and `grep` on
  any agent.
- **Remote Shell**: Jump into any agent's shell.
- **On-Demand Profiling**: High-frequency CPU profiling with Flame Graphs for
  line-level analysis.
- **Live Debugging**: Attach eBPF uprobes (SDK) to specific functions to capture
  args and return values.
- **Traffic Capture**: Sample live requests to understand payload structures.

### 🤖 Diagnose

**AI-powered insights for intelligent Root Cause Analysis (RCA).**

Coral's killer app is its ability to pre-correlate metrics and profiling data
into structured summaries that LLMs can understand instantly.

- **Profiling-Enriched Summaries**: AI gets metrics + code-level hotspots in one
  call.
- **Regression Detection**: Automatically identifies performance shifts across
  deployment versions.
- **Built-in Assistant**: Use `coral ask` directly from your terminal.
- **Universal AI integration**: Works with Claude Desktop, IDEs, any MCP client.

## Architecture: Universal AI Integration via MCP

Colony acts as an MCP server - any AI assistant can query your observability
data in real-time.

## 🔒 Privacy & Sovereignty

Coral is designed for **complete data sovereignty**.

- **Decentralized**: You run the Colony (control plane) on your own
  infrastructure—laptop, VM, or Kubernetes.
- **No SaaS Dependency**: There is no central Coral cloud service. You don't
  send us any data.
- **Bring Your Own LLM**: Your API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) stay on your
  machine. Or use local models (Ollama) for an air-gapped experience.
- **Encrypted Mesh**: All traffic between your laptop, colony, and agents is
  secured via WireGuard.

## How It Works

1. **Observe Everywhere**: Agents collect telemetry via eBPF (zero-config) and
   OTLP.
2. **Aggregate Intelligently**: Colony receives data, stores it in DuckDB, and
   correlates dependencies.
3. **Query with AI**: Connect any MCP client (Claude, IDE) to ask questions in
   natural language.
4. **Act on Insights**: Get root cause analysis and recommendations.

## Live Debugging & Profiling

**Coral can debug your running code without redeploying.**

Unlike traditional observability (metrics, logs, traces), Coral can **actively
instrument** your code on-demand using eBPF uprobes and high-frequency CPU
profiling.

> [!NOTE]
> Detailed function-level tracing requires integrating the **Coral Language
> Runtime SDK**, while CPU profiling and system metrics work
> **agentlessly** on any binary.

```bash
$ coral ask "Why is the payment API slow?"

🤖 Analyzing host metrics and continuous profiles...
   Host: api-v1-pod-abc (CPU: 12%, Mem: 45%)
   Service: payment-api (P95: 2.3s)

   Initial findings: High "Off-CPU" wait time detected in process.
   Executing coral_profile_functions (strategy: critical_path)...

   Analysis of 30s capture:
     • ProcessPayment() total: 2.1s
       └─ Mutex Contention: 1.8s (Blocked by Logger.Write)
       └─ VFS Write (Disk I/O): 1.7s (Wait on /var/log/app.log)

   Root Cause: Synchronous logging to a slow disk volume is blocking the main execution thread.
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Build

```bash
make build-dev
```

### 2. Initialize

```bash
# Initialize the colony configuration
bin/coral init my-colony
```

### 3. Run

```bash
# Start the colony (central coordinator)
bin/coral colony start

# In another terminal, start the agent
bin/coral agent start
```

### 4. Connect (optional)

Connect the agent explicitly to your services to observe them.

By default, the agent will observe all services it can find on the system

```bash
# Connect agent to observe services
bin/coral connect frontend:3000 api:8080:/health
```

### 5. Ask

```bash
# Configure your LLM (first time only)
bin/coral ask config

# Ask questions
bin/coral ask "Why is the API slow?"
```

| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Network**      | **Unified WireGuard Mesh** (Laptop ↔ Cloud ↔ On-prem) | VPNs, Firewalls, Fragmented   |
| **Debugging**    | **Continuous & On-demand eBPF** (Profiling & Probes)  | Logs, Metrics, Profiling.     |
| **AI Model**     | **Bring Your Own LLM** (You own the data)             | Vendor-hosted, Privacy risks  |
| **Architecture** | **Decentralized** (No central SaaS)                   | Centralized SaaS / Data Silos |
| **Analysis**     | **LLM-Driven RCA** (Pre-correlated hotspots)          | Manual Dashboard Diving       |

**This doesn't exist in the market.**

Coral is the first tool that combines:

- LLM-driven analysis
- On-demand eBPF instrumentation
- Distributed debugging
- Zero standing overhead
