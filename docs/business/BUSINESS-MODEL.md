## Business Model

### Philosophy

- **Open source core**: All colony and agent code on GitHub
- **Free forever**: Self-hosted is fully functional
- **Monetize on value-add**: Convenience, not features
- **No bait-and-switch**: Won't pull an "open core" rug pull

### Current: Fully Free

**Free Tier** (Self-hosted):
- Unlimited apps
- All AI features (BYO API keys)
- Community support
- Open source code

**What we provide for free**:
- Discovery service (we absorb hosting cost)
- Documentation
- Community support (Discord/GitHub)

### Future: Optional Paid Tiers

- Email support
- SSO/RBAC

**Team** ($99/month):
- Everything in Pro

**Enterprise** (Custom):

### Alternative: AI API Resale

Instead of subscription tiers, could do:
- Core product stays free
- Charge small markup on AI API calls
- Easier than managing API keys
- Pay-as-you-go model

Example:
- Claude Sonnet: $3/$15 per million tokens (Anthropic pricing)
- Coral: $3.50/$17.50 per million tokens (15% markup)
- Bundled packages: $10/mo, $50/mo, $200/mo
