# RFD XXX - Feature Name

**Status:** 🚧 Draft

<!--
Status progression:
  🚧 Draft → 👀 Under Review → ✅ Approved → 🔄 In Progress → 🎉 Implemented

Aim for "Implemented" status by scoping the RFD to a shippable capability.
Use "Deferred Features" section for out-of-scope work (avoids perpetual "In Progress").
-->

outcome concisely.

## Problem

Detailed problem description:

- **Current behavior/limitations**: Describe what doesn't work or is missing

## API Changes

**THIS IS WHERE DETAIL IS APPROPRIATE**

### New Protobuf Messages

```protobuf
// Full protobuf definitions go here
message NewFeatureRequest {
    string server_id = 1;
    string parameter = 2;
}

message NewFeatureResponse {
    bool success = 1;
    string message = 2;
}
```

### New RPC Endpoints

```protobuf
service ServiceName {
    rpc NewOperation(NewFeatureRequest) returns (NewFeatureResponse);
}
```

### CLI Commands

```bash
# New command with expected output
cli feature action <args> [--flags]

# Example output:
Feature Result:
  Status: Success
  Details: ...
```

### Configuration Changes

- Modified field: `existing.field` now supports additional values

## Testing Strategy

**Optional section**

### Unit Tests

- Component-specific test scope
- Key scenarios to validate
- Error handling coverage

### Integration Tests

- Test against BMC simulators (VirtualBMC, Redfish mock)
- Verify data flow end-to-end

### E2E Tests

- Full stack test scenarios

- Real-world usage patterns

## Security Considerations

**Optional section**

- Authentication/authorization impacts
- Data exposure risks and mitigations
- Credential handling (never expose actual passwords)
- Audit logging requirements
- TLS/encryption requirements

## Migration Strategy

**Optional section - include if backward compatibility is a concern**

1. **Deployment Steps**:

    - Deploy Manager changes
    - Deploy Gateway changes
    - Deploy Agent changes
    - Enable feature flag

2. **Rollback Plan**:
    - Disable feature flag
    - Revert database changes (if needed)
    - No breaking changes to existing workflows

## Implementation Status

**Core Capability:** ✅ Complete | 🔄 In Progress | ⏳ Not Started

[Describe the current state of implementation. Focus on what works now, not what's missing.]

Example:

```
**Core Capability:** ✅ Complete

Agent BMC discovery implemented with IPMI and Redfish support. Agents can
discover servers via DHCP and static configuration, and execute basic power
operations.

**Operational Components:**
- ✅ IPMI discovery and power control
- ✅ Redfish discovery and power control
- ✅ Static configuration via YAML
- ✅ CLI: `bmc-cli server list|power|status`

**What Works Now:**
- Automatic server discovery on local networks
- Remote power operations (on, off, reset, status)
- Health monitoring via bmc dashboard
```

**Integration Status:**

- List any remaining integration work (dependencies, config, deployment)
- Keep this minimal - only critical items blocking production use

## Future Work

**Optional section - use for features that are out of scope**

The following features are out of scope for this RFD. They may be addressed in
future RFDs or are intentionally deferred:

Example:

```
**Advanced Discovery** (Future - RFD XXX)
- IPv6 network discovery
- Multi-subnet scanning
- Cloud provider API integration

**Enhanced Operations** (Blocked by Dependencies)
- BIOS configuration - Requires RFD YYY (secure credential storage)
- Firmware updates - Requires RFD ZZZ (update orchestration)

**Monitoring Enhancements** (Low Priority)
- Temperature sensor trending
- Fan speed alerts
- Detailed inventory tracking
```

**When to Use This Section:**

✅ **DO include** if:

- Features are blocked by other RFDs (creates a dependency chain)
- Features are intentionally out of scope (keeps this RFD focused)
- Features are future enhancements (signals what's next without bloating this
  RFD)

❌ **DO NOT include** if:

- Core functionality is missing (means the RFD isn't complete - narrow the scope
  instead)
- You're listing "nice-to-haves" without clear rationale (bloats the RFD)

## Appendix

**Optional section for technical deep-dives**

### Protocol Details

- Detailed protocol specifications
- Wire formats
- Authentication flows

### Reference Implementations

- Links to similar implementations
- Industry standards (RFCs, specifications)

### Test Configuration Examples

```yaml
# Detailed test setup examples
test:
    config: example
```

## RFD Writing Guidelines

### Scope Management & Completion

**Aim for "Complete" Status:**

RFDs should be scoped to be **fully completable**. Avoid perpetually "In
Progress" RFDs by:

✅ **DO:**

- Narrow scope to a **complete, shippable capability**
- Extract large or blocked features into **separate RFDs** (creates clear
  dependency chains)
- Use **Future Work** section for out-of-scope work (with RFD references)
- Mark RFD "Implemented" when core capability works, even if enhancements are
  deferred

❌ **DO NOT:**

- Leave RFD "In Progress" indefinitely with partial implementation
- Try to fit everything into one mega-RFD (split it!)
- List missing features as "TODO" in main sections (move to Future Work)

**Example - Bad Scope (Too Broad):**

```
RFD: Complete Observability Platform
Status: 🔄 In Progress (30% complete)

Phases:
- [ ] Metrics collection
- [x] Basic dashboards
- [ ] Alerting
- [ ] AI-powered analysis
- [ ] Cost optimization
- [ ] Capacity planning
```

→ This will never be "complete" - too many features!

**Example - Good Scope (Focused & Complete):**

```
RFD 010: Metrics Collection & Storage
Status: ✅ Complete

Core: Agents collect metrics, store locally, colony aggregates.
Future Work: AI analysis (RFD 015), Alerting (RFD 020), Capacity planning (RFD 025)
```

→ Clear what's done, clear what's next, RFD is complete!

**When to Split into Multiple RFDs:**

- Feature is **blocked by another RFD** → Create separate RFD with dependency
- Feature adds **significant complexity** → Keep current RFD focused, create
  follow-up RFD
- Feature is **low priority** → Defer to future RFD, ship core functionality now
- You have **>5 phases** → You probably have 2-3 RFDs hidden in one document

### Content Guidelines

**DO:**

- ✅ Focus on WHAT changes, not HOW to implement every detail
- ✅ Include full API specifications (protobuf, REST endpoints)
- ✅ Include configuration examples (YAML, CLI commands)
- ✅ Show expected output for CLI commands
- ✅ Use diagrams for complex architectures
- ✅ Put protocol details in Appendix
- ✅ Reference files by path only (e.g., `manager/pkg/database/database.go`)
- ✅ Add Implementation Status section when RFD is implemented
- ✅ Use Future Work section to manage scope

**DO NOT:**

- ❌ Include time estimates (weeks, hours, days)
- ❌ Show complete Go/Python implementations
- ❌ Include verbose code that belongs in actual implementation
- ❌ Reference specific line numbers (e.g., `file.go:123` or `lines 45-67`)
- ❌ Use line number ranges - they become stale as code changes
- ❌ Duplicate RPC handler signatures when protobuf already defines the API
- ❌ Show function signatures for internal implementation details
- ❌ Keep RFD "In Progress" when core capability works (mark Complete, defer
  enhancements)

**What to include in API Changes:**

- ✅ Protobuf messages and service definitions (the actual API contract)
- ✅ Database schema changes (migrations, new columns/tables)
- ✅ CLI command usage examples with expected output
- ✅ Configuration file changes
- ❌ Go handler function signatures (implementation detail)
- ❌ Internal database method signatures (implementation detail)

**Why avoid redundant signatures:**

- Protobuf already defines the API contract completely
